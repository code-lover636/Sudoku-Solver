About Sudoku:              
Sudoku is a grid of 9 rows and 9 columns. It is is also divided into 9 sub-grids
Every sudoku puzzle will have some numbers in them (given numbers).
The aim is to fill all boxes in the grid in such a manner that every row, column and sub-grid should have all numbers from 1 to 9 and it must be unique.

Sudoku is a famous game, that everyone has played once in their life unless you live under caves.

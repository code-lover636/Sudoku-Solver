Sudoku is a grid of 9 rows and 9 columns. It is is also divided into 9 sub-grids
Every sudoku puzzle will have some numbers in them (given numbers).
The aim is to fill all boxes in the grid in such a manner that every row, column and sub-grid should have all numbers from 1 to 9 and it must be unique.

Sudoku is a famous game, that everyone has played once in their life unless you live under caves.

FILL THE GIVEN NUMBERS IN THE GRID, IN THE CORRECT PLACE AND SELECT SOLVE FROM DROP DOWN MENU. YOUR SUDOKU IS SOLVED!!!
